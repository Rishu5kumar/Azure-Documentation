# Day 25: Kubernetes in Azure: A Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Introduction to Kubernetes

### The Problem Before Kubernetes
Before the advent of Kubernetes, developers faced several challenges when deploying and managing containerized applications:
- **Manual Scaling**: Scaling applications manually across multiple machines was complex and error-prone.
- **Inconsistent Environments**: Differences in development, testing, and production environments led to inconsistencies and bugs.
- **Complex Orchestration**: Managing dependencies, communication between services, and failover strategies required custom scripts and manual intervention.

### How Kubernetes Solves These Problems
Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications:
- **Automated Scaling**: Kubernetes automatically scales applications based on resource usage.
- **Consistent Environments**: Kubernetes ensures consistency across all environments by running containers with the same configuration.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes handles the orchestration of containers, including networking, load balancing, and failover.

### Scenario and Example
Imagine you have an e-commerce application with several microservices (e.g., payment, inventory, user management). Manually deploying these services on multiple servers can lead to errors and downtime. Kubernetes automates this process, ensuring that each microservice runs in its container, with automatic scaling and self-healing capabilities.

## 2. Introduction to Docker

### What is Docker?
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. A container packages an application and its dependencies together, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments.

### Docker and Kubernetes Relationship
Docker is the container runtime used by Kubernetes. While Docker handles the creation and management of containers, Kubernetes orchestrates and manages these containers across a cluster of machines.

### Differences between Docker and Kubernetes
- **Docker**: Focuses on containerizing applications. It creates and runs containers on a single node.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages and orchestrates containers across a cluster of nodes, handling tasks like scaling, networking, and storage.

## 3. Kubernetes Architecture

### Overview of Kubernetes Architecture
Kubernetes architecture is based on a master-slave (control plane and worker nodes) model. The **control plane** manages the overall state of the cluster, while **worker nodes** run the application workloads.

### Master Node Components
- **Kubernetes API Server**: The API server acts as the frontend for the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API, which is used by internal and external components to interact with the cluster.
- **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that holds all the cluster data, such as configuration and state information. It acts as the source of truth for the cluster.
- **Kube-Scheduler**: The scheduler assigns pods (the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes) to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.
- **Kube-Controller-Manager**: This component runs controllers that regulate the state of the cluster, such as the node controller, replication controller, and endpoint controller.

### Worker Node Components
- **Kubelet**: An agent that runs on each worker node. It ensures that the containers in a pod are running as expected.
- **Kube-Proxy**: Manages network communication for pods, enabling them to communicate with each other and with services inside and outside the cluster.
- **Container Runtime (Docker)**: The software responsible for running the containers. Docker is the most commonly used container runtime in Kubernetes.

### Single Master with Multiple Worker Nodes Setup
In a typical setup, you have a single master node managing multiple worker nodes. The master node handles control plane tasks, while the worker nodes run the actual application workloads.

### One Master and Two Worker Nodes Scenario
Consider a scenario with one master and two worker nodes. The master node manages the cluster, while the two worker nodes run the applications. This setup provides high availability and load balancing.

### Explanation of Terms like Kubelet, Kube-Proxy, etc.
- **Kubelet**: Monitors and manages the containers on a worker node.
- **Kube-Proxy**: Handles networking for the Kubernetes pods, ensuring proper routing and load balancing.
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, usually containing one or more containers.

## 4. Kubernetes Clusters

### What is a Kubernetes Cluster?
A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run containerized applications managed by the Kubernetes control plane. The cluster ensures that your applications run as intended, even as nodes fail or scale.

### Setting up a Kubernetes Cluster in Azure
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplifies the deployment, management, and operations of Kubernetes clusters in Azure. AKS handles critical tasks like scaling, monitoring, and upgrades.

### Components and Architecture of a Kubernetes Cluster
A Kubernetes cluster typically consists of a control plane (master node) and multiple worker nodes. The control plane manages the state of the cluster, while the worker nodes run the containerized applications.

### Setting up Multiple Nodes in Azure
In Azure, you can set up multiple VMs in the same virtual network and configure them as nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. This setup allows you to scale your applications across multiple machines.

---

## 5. Setting Up Kubernetes in Azure

### Prerequisites for Setting Up Kubernetes
- **Azure Subscription**: You need an active Azure subscription.
- **Azure CLI**: Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed if you want to use it for additional configuration tasks.
- **Networking**: Ensure that all VMs can communicate with each other and have access to the internet.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Setup on Azure

1. **Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster**

   - **Step 1**: Log in to the Azure Portal.
   - **Step 2**: Navigate to **Azure Kubernetes Service** by searching for "Kubernetes services" in the search bar.
   - **Step 3**: Click on **Create**.
   - **Step 4**: Fill in the required details:
     - **Resource Group**: Create a new resource group or select an existing one.
     - **Kubernetes Cluster Name**: Give your cluster a name.
     - **Region**: Select the region closest to you.
     - **Node Size**: Choose the size of your nodes (e.g., Standard_DS2_v2).
     - **Node Count**: Select the number of nodes (e.g., 2).
   - **Step 5**: Configure the **Authentication** and **Networking** settings as required. For basic setups, you can use the defaults.
   - **Step 6**: Review and create the cluster.

2. **Accessing the Kubernetes Dashboard**

   - **Step 1**: Once the cluster is created, navigate to the resource group and select your AKS cluster.
   - **Step 2**: Under **Cluster Monitoring**, select **View Kubernetes dashboard**.
   - **Step 3**: Follow the instructions to set up access. You may need to create a service account and get the `kubeconfig` file.

3. **Configuring Nodes**

   - Azure AKS automatically configures the nodes as part of the cluster creation. You can scale the nodes later by going to the **Node pools** section in the AKS cluster.

### Swap Memory Management
- **Azure**: Swap memory management in Azure Kubernetes is handled automatically by the AKS service, so you typically don't need to manage this manually unless you're dealing with specific workloads.

### Network Configuration Using Azure Portal
- **Network Plugin**: During the AKS setup, you can select the network plugin (Azure CNI or Kubenet) that best fits your needs. Azure CNI is recommended for advanced networking scenarios.

## 6. Deploying Applications on Kubernetes

### Deploying an Application in a Kubernetes Cluster

1. **Use the Azure Kubernetes Dashboard**
   - **Step 1**: Access the Kubernetes dashboard as described in the previous section.
   - **Step 2**: Click on **Create** and choose to upload a YAML file or use the form to deploy your application.
   - **Step 3**: Fill in the details or upload your YAML file to create a deployment.

2. **Expose the Deployment as a Service**
   - **Step 1**: Once the deployment is created, select it from the dashboard.
   - **Step 2**: Under the **Services** tab, click on **Expose** to create a service for your deployment.
   - **Step 3**: Choose the type of service (e.g., LoadBalancer) to expose your application to the internet.

### Accessing the Application via Public IP
- After creating a service with the LoadBalancer type, the Azure Portal will automatically provision a public IP for your application. You can find this IP under the **Services** section in the Kubernetes dashboard.

### Rolling Updates and Deployment Strategies

1. **Rolling Update**
   - Use the Azure Kubernetes dashboard or `kubectl` to update your deployments. For a rolling update:
   - **Step 1**: Modify the deployment file or update the image directly from the dashboard.
   - **Step 2**: Kubernetes will automatically perform the rolling update without downtime.

2. **Rolling Back**
   - If something goes wrong, you can roll back to a previous version directly from the Kubernetes dashboard or using `kubectl`.
