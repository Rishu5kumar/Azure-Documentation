## Azure Static Website Hosting

### Introduction

Hosting a static website in Azure involves using Azure Storage to serve static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images directly from a storage account.
### VM Configuration as a Web Server:

- Windows: Internet Information Services (IIS)
- Linux: Apache2
### Steps to Host a Static Website

1. **Create a Storage Account**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to "Storage accounts".
   - Click "Create" and fill in the required details.

2. **Enable Static Website Hosting**:
   - Go to your storage account.
   - Under "Settings", click on "Static website".
   - Enable the feature and specify the index document (e.g., `index.html`).

3. **Upload Website Content**:
   - Use Azure Storage Explorer or the Azure portal to upload your static files to the `$web` container.

4. **Access Your Website**:
   - Copy the primary endpoint URL provided under the static website settings and paste it in a browser to view your site.

### Advantages of Static Website Hosting:

- Ease of Use: Provides a URL, HTTPS, and certificate automatically.
- Simplified Management: Requires less maintenance and management.
- Cost-Effective

### Azure Storage Explorer

Azure Storage Explorer simplifies managing Azure Storage resources.

#### Use Cases:

- Replicating a VM to Another VM:
Example: Creating a backup of a production VM to a test environment.
- Replicating from One Tenant to Another Tenant:
Example: Migrating data from a development tenant to a production tenant for deployment.

#### Key Features
- User-friendly interface
- Cross-platform support
- Manage blobs, file shares, queues, and tables
- Access control with SAS and access policies

#### Example: Uploading a File

1. **Download and Install**:
   - Download Azure Storage Explorer from the official website and install it.

2. **Connect to Your Azure Account**:
   - Open Azure Storage Explorer.
   - Click "Add an Account" and sign in with your Azure credentials.

3. **Navigate and Upload**:
   - Navigate to your storage account and open the `$web` container.
   - Click "Upload" and select "Upload Files...".
   - Choose the file to upload and complete the process.

## Migration Strategies

### Migrating VM Content

To migrate contents of one VM to another:

1. **Stop the Source VM**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to the source VM and stop it.

2. **Copy the Disk**:
   - In Azure Storage Explorer, find the VHD file of the source VM.
   - Copy the VHD file to the desired location (within the same or different subscription).

3. **Create a New VM**:
   - Use the copied VHD file to create a new VM in the Azure portal.

### Example: VM-to-VM Migration

**Scenario**: Replicating VM-1 to VM-2 within the same subscription.

1. **Stop VM-1**.
2. **Copy VM-1 Disk**:
   - Use Azure Storage Explorer to copy the VHD file of VM-1.
3. **Create VM-2**:
   - In the Azure portal, create a new VM using the copied VHD file.
   - Ensure both VMs have unique public IP addresses.

## Managed and Unmanaged Disks

### Overview

Disks in Azure are block-level storage volumes used with Azure VMs. There are two types: managed and unmanaged disks.

### Managed Disks

Managed disks are managed by Azure, simplifying management and scaling.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Azure manages the storage account.
- Highly scalable.
- Simplifies VM management.
- Automatically distributed for high availability.
- Cost: Pay for used space.

**Use Case**: Preferred for ease of use, scalability, and management simplicity.

### Unmanaged Disks

Unmanaged disks require manual management of storage accounts and VHD files.

**Key Characteristics**:
- User manages storage accounts.
- Limited by storage account capacity.
- Requires manual distribution of VHD files.
- Cost: Pay for storage account capacity and used space.

**Use Case**: Suitable for scenarios requiring manual storage management.

| Feature                | Managed Disks             | Unmanaged Disks            |
|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Storage Account Mgmt   | Managed by Azure          | Managed by user            |
| Scalability            | Highly scalable           | Limited by storage account |
| Simplicity             | Simple                    | Complex                    |
| Availability           | Auto-distributed          | Manual distribution        |
| Cost                   | Pay for used space        | Pay for capacity and space |
