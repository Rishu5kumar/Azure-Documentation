Private registry
## Dockerfile

### What It Is
A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions on how to build a Docker image. It acts as a recipe, detailing everything that should be included in the image.

### Why Use It
Dockerfiles automate the creation of Docker images. Instead of manually setting up your environment and application each time, you define the setup once in a Dockerfile.

### How It Works
You write instructions in a Dockerfile, specifying:
- **Base image** to start with.
- **Software** to install.
- **Files** to copy.
  
Docker reads these instructions and creates an image based on them when you run the `docker build` command.

### Imagine Baking a Cake
- **Dockerfile (Recipe Card)**: A Dockerfile is like a recipe card for baking a cake. It lists all the ingredients and steps to make the cake perfectly.
  
### Scenario
- **Baking the Cake**: Suppose you want to bake a chocolate cake. You have a recipe card that tells you:
  - The type of flour and sugar to use.
  - The exact amount of cocoa powder.
  - The steps for mixing and baking.
- **Following the Recipe**: Each time you follow the recipe card, you end up with a delicious chocolate cake, regardless of the kitchen you use.
- **Sharing the Recipe**: If you give the recipe card to a friend, they can bake the exact same chocolate cake.

### How This Relates to Dockerfile
- **Creating a Container**: A Dockerfile includes all the instructions for setting up a container:
  - Base image (like choosing the type of flour).
  - Additional software/tools (like adding cocoa powder).
  - Configuration steps (like mixing and baking).
- **Reproducibility**: Using the same Dockerfile will always create the same container environment, ensuring consistency.

### Basic Structure of a Dockerfile

1. **Start with a Base Image**
   ```Dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:20.04
   ```

2. **Set the Maintainer (Optional)**
   ```Dockerfile
   LABEL maintainer="your-email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Update and Install Dependencies**
   ```Dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
       curl \
       vim \
       git
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables (Optional)**
   ```Dockerfile
   ENV APP_HOME /app
   ```

5. **Copy Files into the Container**
   ```Dockerfile
   COPY . /app
   ```

6. **Set the Working Directory**
   ```Dockerfile
   WORKDIR /app
   ```

7. **Install Application Dependencies**
   ```Dockerfile
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

8. **Expose Ports**
   ```Dockerfile
   EXPOSE 8080
   ```

9. **Define the Command to Run the Application**
   ```Dockerfile
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

### Example Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image as a base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the maintainer label
LABEL maintainer="your-email@example.com"

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Steps to Build and Run the Docker Image

1. **Save the Dockerfile**
   Save the Dockerfile in the root of your project directory.

2. **Build the Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-python-app .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 4000:5000 my-python-app
   ```

### Dockerfile Commands

1. **FROM**: Specifies the base image for the Dockerfile.  
   *Example:* `FROM ubuntu:20.04`

2. **RUN**: Executes commands to build the image, typically used for installing software.  
   *Example:* `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3`

3. **CMD**: Sets the default command to run when a container starts. Only one CMD per Dockerfile is allowed.  
   *Example:* `CMD ["python3", "app.py"]`

4. **ENTRYPOINT**: Configures the container to run as an executable. It cannot be overridden by arguments passed to `docker run`.  
   *Example:* `ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "app.py"]`

5. **COPY**: Copies files or directories from the host into the image.  
   *Example:* `COPY . /app`

6. **ADD**: Similar to COPY, but also extracts tar files and supports remote URLs.  
   *Example:* `ADD https://example.com/app.tar.gz /app`

7. **ENV**: Sets environment variables within the image.  
   *Example:* `ENV APP_ENV=production`

8. **EXPOSE**: Documents the ports the container listens on at runtime.  
   *Example:* `EXPOSE 8080`

9. **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions.  
   *Example:* `WORKDIR /app`

10. **VOLUME**: Creates a mount point for external volumes.  
    *Example:* `VOLUME /data`

11. **USER**: Sets the user name or UID for running commands.  
    *Example:* `USER appuser`

12. **ARG**: Defines build-time variables that can be passed with `docker build`.  
    *Example:* `ARG VERSION=1.0`

13. **LABEL**: Adds metadata to the image in key-value pairs, often used for versioning and maintainer information.  
    *Example:* `LABEL maintainer="you@example.com"`

14. **ONBUILD**: Adds a trigger instruction to be executed when the image is used as a base for another build.  
    *Example:* `ONBUILD COPY . /app`

## Terraform

**Terraform** is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and manage your cloud infrastructure using configuration files. By using Terraform, you can handle both low-level components like compute instances and high-level components like DNS entries.

### Key Features of Terraform

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Describes infrastructure in code for version control and reproducibility.
2. **Execution Plans:** Generates a plan showing what will change before applying configurations.
3. **Resource Graph:** Builds a graph of resources to manage dependencies and order of operations.
4. **Change Automation:** Applies only necessary changes, reducing manual errors.


### Key Concepts

- **Provider:** A plugin to interact with cloud services (e.g., Azure).
- **Resource:** The infrastructure components you manage (e.g., VMs, networks).
- **State:** Keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure.
- **Modules:** Reusable configuration blocks.

### Basic Workflow

1. **Write Configuration:** Define infrastructure in `.tf` files.
2. **Initialize:** Run `terraform init` to set up and download plugins.
3. **Plan:** Run `terraform plan` to preview changes.
4. **Apply:** Run `terraform apply` to create/update resources.
5. **Destroy:** Run `terraform destroy` to delete resources.

### Example: Creating a Resource Group and Virtual Network

**Configuration (main.tf):**

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}
```

**Commands:**

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

### Advantages of Terraform

1. **Consistency:** Ensures consistent infrastructure across environments.
2. **Automation:** Automates provisioning and management of resources.
3. **Scalability:** Manages infrastructure at any scale.
4. **Multi-Cloud:** Supports multiple cloud providers.
