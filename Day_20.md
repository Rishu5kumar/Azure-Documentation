## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using a serverless LLaMA-3-8b model hosted on Azure ML endpoints. By integrating a local vector database, FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), the system can retrieve relevant information and maintain context in conversations. This ensures that the AI can generate accurate and context-aware responses, addressing the common limitation of statelessness in large language models (LLMs).

## Importance of Memory in LLMs
LLMs, despite their powerful capabilities, lack the ability to remember previous interactions, leading to potential hallucinations when asked follow-up questions. To overcome this, we incorporate mechanisms like `history_aware_retriever` or `ConversationalBufferMemory` to maintain context across interactions. This project demonstrates the use of both approaches to enhance the conversational abilities of the AI.

## Implementation Steps

### Architecture
The architecture comprises two main components:
1. **Standard RAG Workflow**: Integrates the Azure ML endpoint with FAISS for vector retrieval.
2. **Conversational RAG Workflow**: Adds memory management to maintain chat history and context.

### Key Components

#### Azure ML Endpoint Configuration
- **Setup**: Establish a secure connection to the Azure ML endpoint hosting the LLaMA-3-8b model.
- **Parameters**: Configure authentication, API key, and endpoint URL to ensure reliable communication.

#### LLaMA Model Interface and Parameter Tuning
- **Interface Development**: Create a control interface for interacting with the model.
- **Parameter Tuning**:
  - **Temperature**: Controls response creativity and randomness.
  - **Max Tokens**: Limits the length of responses for conciseness.
  - **Top P (nucleus sampling)**: Balances response diversity and quality.

#### Retrieval System Integration
- **Setup**: Convert the vector database into a retriever.
- **Function**: Enhance the model's ability to fetch relevant contextual information during conversations.

#### Conversation Chain Construction
- **Memory Management**: Use `ConversationBufferMemory` to store chat history.
- **ConversationalRetrievalChain**: Combine the LLaMA model interface, retriever, and memory to manage the flow of conversation and generate context-aware responses.

### Final Output
The fully configured conversation chain integrates Azure ML's LLaMA model, the vector retriever, and memory management, resulting in an advanced, context-aware conversational AI system. This project showcases the effective use of Azure ML and FAISS to build a robust conversational AI that can maintain context and provide accurate responses, making it suitable for various applications requiring intelligent and contextually aware interactions.

## When to Use the RAG Concept?
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) concept should be used when you need an AI system that can provide accurate and contextually relevant answers by combining the strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the ability to retrieve specific information from a database.

### Simple Scenario: Customer Support Chatbot
If you're building a customer support chatbot for a company with a vast knowledge base (like manuals, FAQs, and past support tickets), using RAG can help the bot quickly fetch relevant information to answer customer queries accurately and contextually, improving the overall user experience.

## Implementing RAG for a Customer Support Chatbot

### Steps:

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
    - Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`transformers`, `faiss`, `langchain`, etc.).
2. **Prepare the Knowledge Base**:
    - Gather and preprocess the company's knowledge base (manuals, FAQs, past support tickets).
    - Convert the text data into a format suitable for vectorization.
3. **Vectorize the Knowledge Base**:
    - Use a model (e.g., Sentence Transformers) to convert text data into vector embeddings.
    - Store these embeddings in a vector database like FAISS for efficient retrieval.
4. **Integrate with an LLM**:
    - Set up an API endpoint for a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI's GPT or a similar model hosted on Azure ML.
    - Configure the LLM to receive context from the retriever.
5. **Implement the Retrieval System**:
    - Create a retriever that searches the vector database for relevant information based on the user's query.
    - Retrieve the top-k most relevant documents or snippets.
6. **Combine Retrieval with Generation**:
    - Pass the retrieved documents along with the user query to the LLM.
    - The LLM uses the context from the retrieved documents to generate a more accurate and relevant response.
7. **Maintain Context**:
    - Use a conversation memory system to maintain context over multiple turns.
    - Implement `ConversationBufferMemory` to store the history of interactions.
8. **Develop the Chat Interface**:
    - Build a user-friendly chat interface using a web framework (e.g., Streamlit, Flask).
    - Display both user queries and AI responses, ensuring the system uses the conversation memory.
9. **Error Handling and Logging**:
    - Implement error handling to manage any issues during API calls or retrieval processes.
    - Add logging to monitor the performance and debug issues.
10. **Deploy the Chatbot**:
    - Deploy the chatbot application to a cloud platform (e.g., Azure, AWS).
    - Ensure the application is scalable and can handle multiple concurrent users.

### Example Code Outline

Here's a high-level outline of the implementation:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.retrievers import LocalRetriever
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

# Step 2: Preprocess and vectorize knowledge base
# (Assuming data is preprocessed and stored in `knowledge_base`)

# Step 3: Create vector embeddings and store in FAISS
vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(knowledge_base)

# Step 5: Implement the retriever
retriever = LocalRetriever(vector_store)

# Step 6: Integrate with LLM
llm = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Step 7: Combine retrieval with generation
def get_conversation_chain():
    memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
    chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain(llm, retriever, memory)
    return chain

# Step 8: Develop the chat interface (simplified)
import streamlit as st

st.title("Customer Support Chatbot")
chat_chain = get_conversation_chain()

if 'chat_history' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.chat_history = []

user_input = st.text_input("Ask a question:")

if user_input:
    response = chat_chain.run(user_input)
    st.session_state.chat_history.append({"user": user_input, "bot": response})

for chat in st.session_state.chat_history:
    st.write(f"User: {chat['user']}")
    st.write(f"Bot: {chat['bot']}")

# Step 9: Error handling and logging (not shown for brevity)

# Step 10: Deploy the chatbot (not shown for brevity)
```

## How It Works
The RAG system gives data like PDFs/text files and takes the user's query based on this data to provide answers. The model will scan the PDF and generate answers for the user.

### Interaction Flow

1. **User Query**: The user enters a question or query into the chatbot interface.
2. **Retrieval Phase**:
   - The chatbot uses the query to search the vector database (e.g., FAISS) for relevant information. This database contains vector embeddings of the company's knowledge base (manuals, FAQs, past support tickets, etc.).
   - The retriever selects the top-k most relevant documents or snippets that match the user's query based on similarity.
3. **Generation Phase**:
   - The retrieved documents or snippets are combined with the user's query.
   - This combined context is passed to a language model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT or another hosted model).
   - The language model generates a response based on the user's query and the additional context provided

 by the retrieved documents.
4. **Response Delivery**:
   - The chatbot sends the generated response back to the user through the chat interface.
   - The conversation memory (using `ConversationBufferMemory`) is updated to include this latest interaction, maintaining context for future queries.

### Example Interaction Flow

1. **User Query**: "How can I reset my password?"
2. **Retrieval Phase**:
   - The chatbot searches the vector database for documents related to password reset procedures.
   - It retrieves snippets from the user manual, FAQ, and past support tickets that explain how to reset a password.
3. **Generation Phase**:
   - The retrieved snippets are combined with the user's query.
   - The language model generates a response like: "To reset your password, go to the account settings page, click 'Forgot Password,' and follow the instructions. If you encounter issues, check the FAQ section or contact support."
4. **Response Delivery**:
   - The chatbot sends the response to the user.
   - The interaction is stored in conversation memory, so if the user asks a follow-up question like, "What if I don't receive the reset email?" the chatbot can refer to the previous context and provide a coherent response.

This approach ensures that the chatbot can provide accurate and contextually relevant answers, improving the overall user experience in scenarios like customer support.

## Embeddings

Embeddings are numerical representations of data, often text, that capture meaning, context, and relationships in a continuous vector space. They are essential in machine learning and NLP tasks as they enable meaningful comparison and manipulation of data.

### Example
Consider the words "king" and "queen." In a well-trained embedding space, these words will be close to each other due to their similar meanings and contexts. For example:
- King: [0.4, 0.2, 0.8, ...]
- Queen: [0.3, 0.1, 0.9, ...]

The small distance between these vectors, measured by cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, etc., indicates their semantic similarity. Similar relationships can be observed with other pairs like "apple" and "banana" or "arrow" and "bow."

## LLM vs LangChain

  - An LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data and leverage complex neural network architectures to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

  - LangChain: You can use LangChain to build a more complex application that utilizes LLaMA for specific tasks, such as creating a conversational agent that uses LLaMA to generate responses and a retrieval system to fetch relevant documents.

**NOTE:** LLMs are the core models for generating text, while LangChain is a framework that enhances how these models are used in applications.

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) 
It is a concept that combines both an LLM and retrieval techniques:
    1. LLM Component: The generative part of RAG, which is responsible for creating coherent text based on the retrieved information. This is often a pre-trained language model like GPT-3 or LLaMA.
    2. Retrieval Component: The system that retrieves relevant documents or data from a knowledge base or database to provide context or additional information for the LLM to generate more accurate and informed responses.
