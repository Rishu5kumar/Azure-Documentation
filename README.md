Azure Training Documentation
Welcome to my Azure training documentation repository. This repository contains detailed notes and explanations from my summer training classes on Azure. Each session is organized day-wise with the topics covered.

This repository captures the essence of working with Azure. Spanning nearly a month, the experience provided an in-depth exploration of Azureâ€™s extensive capabilities, ranging from networking to virtual machines, storage, and beyond. This documentation aims to be a thorough resource on the topics covered and the procedures followed during the internship.

I welcome your input! If you spot any errors or have ideas for enhancements, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request or open an issue.
