## Introduction
Network Security Groups (NSGs) are crucial for managing and controlling network traffic to and from Azure resources. They act as virtual firewalls, allowing or denying traffic based on defined security rules.

## Key Concepts
NSGs operate at multiple levels within Azure:
- **Network Interface**: Directly associated with a VM's NIC.
- **Subnet**: Applied to all resources within the subnet.
- **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Directly associated with a VM, using either NIC or subnet association.
- **NSG Attachment**:
**VM Level**: NSG is attached directly to a VM's NIC to control its inbound and outbound traffic.
**Subnet Level**: NSG is applied to a subnet to enforce security rules across all VMs within that subnet.

NSGs are:
- **Stateful**: Automatically allows response traffic for permitted inbound requests.
- **Security Rules**: Defined for inbound and outbound traffic based on IP address, port, and protocol.
- **Priority**: Determines the order in which rules are evaluated (lower number indicates higher priority).
- **Scope**: Can be applied to individual resources or entire subnets.

## Components of NSGs
1. **Inbound Security Rules**: Control inbound traffic.
2. **Outbound Security Rules**: Control outbound traffic.
3. **Priority**: Determines rule evaluation order.
4. **Source/Destination**: Specifies IP address ranges.
5. **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, ICMP, or Any.
6. **Port Range**: Specific ports or ranges.
7. **Action**: Allow or deny traffic based on rules.

## Inbound and Outbound Traffic
### Inbound Port Rule
An **inbound port rule** in Azure NSGs controls incoming network traffic to Azure resources, such as virtual machines (VMs) or subnets. It specifies the conditions under which incoming traffic is allowed or denied based on defined criteria. Here are the key components of an inbound port rule:
- **Priority**: Determines the order in which rules are evaluated. Lower numbers indicate higher priority.
- **Source**: Specifies the source IP address or IP address range from which the incoming traffic originates.
- **Source Port Range**: Specifies the port or range of ports on the source side.
- **Destination**: Specifies the destination IP address or IP address range to which the traffic is directed.
- **Destination Port Range**: Specifies the port or range of ports on the destination side.
- **Protocol**: Specifies the network protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, or Any) used for the traffic.
- **Action**: Specifies whether to allow or deny traffic that matches the rule.

**Example**: To allow SSH access (port 22) from a specific IP address range (e.g., your office network) to a VM in Azure, you would create an inbound port rule that allows TCP traffic on port 22 from your office IP range to the VM's IP address.

### Outbound Port Rule
An **outbound port rule** in Azure NSGs controls outgoing network traffic from Azure resources to external destinations. It defines the conditions under which outgoing traffic is allowed or denied based on specified criteria. Here are the key components of an outbound port rule:
- **Priority**: Determines the order in which rules are evaluated. Lower numbers indicate higher priority.
- **Source**: Specifies the source IP address or IP address range from which the outgoing traffic originates.
- **Source Port Range**: Specifies the port or range of ports on the source side.
- **Destination**: Specifies the destination IP address or IP address range to which the traffic is directed.
- **Destination Port Range**: Specifies the port or range of ports on the destination side.
- **Protocol**: Specifies the network protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, or Any) used for the traffic.
- **Action**: Specifies whether to allow or deny traffic that matches the rule.

**Example**: To allow HTTP traffic (port 80) from a VM in Azure to the internet, you would create an outbound port rule that allows TCP traffic on port 80 from the VM's IP address to any destination.

## Understanding Ports
In networking, **ports** are like doors on a building. They allow different types of data to pass through specific entrances (ports) on your Azure resources. Each port is associated with a particular type of service or application. A Port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. It is a software-based concept managed by a computer’s operating system. Each port is associated with a specific process or service. 
So whenever an application runs, It takes the network ports and through that port it allows the data to come from or transmits the data. Here's how it works:

- **Port Numbers**: Ports are identified by numbers, ranging from 0 to 65535.
- **Well-Known Ports**: Ports 0 to 1023 are reserved for well-known services (e.g., HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443).
- **Dynamic and Private Ports**: Ports 1024 to 49151 are registered ports for applications. Ports 49152 to 65535 are dynamic and private ports.
- **Example**: When you access a website (e.g., http://example.com), your browser uses port 80 (HTTP) by default to communicate with the web server. If it's a secure connection (https://example.com), it uses port 443 (HTTPS).

Ports in NSGs:
- **Inbound Ports**: Control incoming traffic to Azure resources. For example, allowing SSH (port 22) access to a VM.
- **Outbound Ports**: Manage outgoing traffic from Azure resources. For example, permitting HTTP (port 80) traffic from a VM to access external web services.


## Steps to Create an NSG
1. **Create an NSG**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Click on **Create a resource**.
   - Search for **Network Security Group**.
   - Click **Create** and fill in necessary details (name, region, etc.).

2. **Define Inbound and Outbound Security Rules**:
   - Navigate to your NSG resource in the Azure portal.
   - Under **Settings**, click on **Inbound security rules** or **Outbound security rules**.
   - Click **+ Add** to add a new rule.
   - Specify details such as:
     - **Priority**: Order of rule evaluation (lower number has higher priority).
     - **Source/Destination**: IP address ranges or application security groups.
     - **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, or Any.
     - **Port Range**: Specific ports or ranges.
     - **Action**: Allow or Deny.
     - **Description**: Optional, to describe the rule purpose.

3. **Associate NSG with Resources**:
   - To apply NSG to a subnet:
     - Go to the Azure portal.
     - Navigate to the subnet where you want to associate the NSG.
     - Under **Settings**, click on **Network security group**.
     - Associate the NSG you created.

   - To apply NSG to a VM:
     - Go to the Azure portal.
     - Navigate to the VM's **Networking** settings.
     - Under **Network security group**, associate the NSG.

## Examples and Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Managing Access with Inbound Port Rules
#### Prioritizing NSG Rules
NSG rules are evaluated based on priority. Lower numbers indicate higher priority. For example:
- If you create two inbound port rules—one with a lower number priority and a deny action, and another with a higher number priority and an allow action—the lower priority rule takes precedence, denying access.

### Scenario 2: Connecting VMs with Different IP Types
If you have VMs with both public and private IPs within the same VNet:
- They can communicate directly within the VNet. You can manage this by associating NSGs at the subnet level or individual VM level to control access.

### Scenario 3: Inbound Port Rule Challenges
Consider a scenario with VMs:
- **Scenario**: Two VMs with public IPs in one subnet and a VM with a private IP (db-vm) in another subnet within the same VNet.
- **Solution**: To connect the VM with a private IP when connected to one VM with a public IP (jump-vm), and not to another (web-vm), adjust NSG inbound rules:
  - Allow the private IP of jump-vm in db-vm's inbound port rule.
  - Deny the private IP of web-vm in db-vm's inbound port rule.

### Scenario 4: Outbound Port Rule Challenges
Consider two VMs:
- **Scenario**: One VM (jump-vm) needs to deny access to google.com, while another VM (web-vm) allows it.
- **Solution**: Use outbound port rules in NSGs to:
  - Deny access to google.com from jump-vm.
  - Allow access to google.com from web-vm.

## Conclusion
Understanding inbound and outbound traffic, managing ports effectively, and configuring NSG rules are essential for maintaining network security in Azure. By implementing these practices, you can ensure secure and controlled access to your Azure resources.
